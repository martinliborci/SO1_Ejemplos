struct with flexible array member
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Initialization, sizeof, and the assignment operator
ignore the flexible array member. 

Structures with flexible array members (or unions whose
last member is a structure with flexible array member)
cannot appear as array elements or as members of other structures.
